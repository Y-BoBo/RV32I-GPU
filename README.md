<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project
We want to enable small companies to develop purpose-built processors and GPUs without paying a royalty. There are numerous free and commercial IP building blocks for RISC-V-based system-on-chips (SoCs), but the portfolio lacks a graphics option so we decided to develop and offer open-source GPUs based on the RISC-V architecture.  


#### Key Features
RV64X-designed GPUs use a basic RV32I or RV64I core that supports new instructions built on the base vector instruction set. Initially, it will use an RV32I core, and later on, an RV64I core will replace it. The basic RISC-V core will support:

1. New graphics and machine learning specific data types, including scalars and matrices;
2. Vector/math instructions; 
3. Pixel/texture instructions; 
4. Frame buffer instructions; 
5. A special register set (featuring configurable 136-bit vector registers);
5. Some graphics-specific instructions; 


The graphics core will support the Vulkan API, but the group strives to make it DirectX (shader model 5) and OpenGL/ES-compliant. :smile:  

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how we want to give instructions on setting up the project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```JS
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

We will use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.
